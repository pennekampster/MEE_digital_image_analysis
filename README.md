Digital image analysis with ImageJ, Python or R
===============================================
The repository contains three scripts to perform automated image analysis. They belong to the article 
"Implementing image analysis in laboratory-based experimental systems for ecology and evolution: a hands-on guide" 
published by Pennekamp and Schtickzelle (2013) in Methods in Ecology & Evolution. The article and a set of test images
are provided at the journal homepage: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12036/abstract
